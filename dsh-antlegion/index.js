/**
 * @antlegion/dsh — turn a DeepSeek Harness process into an AntLegion DCU.
 *
 * Two halves, one plugin:
 *
 *   tools    the seven bus ops handed to the model (publish/query/claim/
 *            resolve/state/observe/causation) — how the agent ACTS.
 *   resident a long-lived Agent plus a plain-Node patrol over the fact bus —
 *            how the agent gets WOKEN, with no human in the loop.
 *
 * The split is the point: perception is deterministic Node code (poll, fold,
 * select), and only the act of deciding what to do about a fact costs an LLM
 * turn. Facts, not commands — the patrol never tells the agent what to do, it
 * hands it what happened.
