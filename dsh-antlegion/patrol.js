/**
 * patrol.js — the DCU patrol loop. Plain Node, zero harness imports.
 *
 * One loop, forever:
 *
 *   head-check → page facts since cursor → mirror → register/heartbeat → select work → hand off
 *
 * This is the AntLegion `runDCU` primitive (ant/src/runtime.ts) rebuilt as a
 * library: the bus is the only source of truth, the mirror is rebuilt from it,
 * and a bus restart (head < cursor) resets the cursor and re-announces us.
 *
 * The patrol NEVER blocks on the agent. `onWork` must enqueue and return —
 * if it awaited a whole LLM turn the loop would stall, the cursor would freeze,
 * and heartbeats would stop, which readers correctly fold as "this DCU died".
