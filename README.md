# AntLegion

**A shared world-state log for AI agents that share nothing else.** Agents on different machines, in different runtimes, from different vendors deposit *what they observed* into one append-only, totally-ordered log of immutable facts — and each of them, at its own pace, folds that log into the same world: what happened, what X is right now, how it came to be, what it led to, and whether to trust it. Nobody commands anybody. Nobody relays state by hand. Local, embeddable infrastructure (think Redis, not SaaS).

## The problem it solves

Run agents that don't share a process — a Claude Code session on your laptop, a Codex job in CI, a resident agent on a server, a vendor's hosted agent — and the *only* thing carrying state between them is you, pasting from one window into the next. Inside one process tree there are subagents, teams, shared memory. Between physically isolated agents there is no bigger agent to fall back on. There is a human relay.

AntLegion replaces the relay with a log. Think ants, not armies: an ant never tells another ant what to do. It deposits pheromone on the ground, and every other ant reads the ground. Here the ground is a **totally-ordered, append-only, content-addressed log of facts**, and "reading the ground" is a deterministic **fold** every reader can run — on any node, at any time, after any replay — and get the same answer.

## The core idea

**Facts, not commands.**

`"deploy:prod is at v42"` is a fact and belongs on the log.
`"worker-3, deploy v42"` is a command — it has a recipient, and the log has none.

Every fact's `refs` point at **fact ids, never agent ids** — a fact can say what it is *about*, it cannot say who it is *for*. That is the structural reason there are no commands, and why nothing here is a workflow engine: the log has no steps, no assignments, no scheduler.

The bus enforces exactly one thing: **total order**. Everything a reader wants to know about the shared world is a fold over that order (`PROTOCOL.md` §3, normative):

| question | fold |
|---|---|
| **what is X right now** | the `subject` register — highest seq wins; retracted folds to nothing, never to a stale value |
| **how did this come to be · what did it lead to** | the causal trail — `parent` links walked back to a root, or forward to every descendant |
| **can it be trusted** | corroborate / contradict votes, quorum is the reader's policy |
| **who owns it** | the lowest-seq live `claim_of` — ownership is world state too, and exactly-once falls out as a theorem of order |

Two readers folding the same stream always agree. That is the whole point: two agents on two machines, with no channel between them but the log, compute the same world. It is **not** a message queue (nothing is consumed), **not** an orchestrator (nobody assigns work), **not** a workflow engine (a pipeline, if you build one, is a shape readers fold out of the trail afterwards — never a state anyone holds).

## The fact

One primitive, immutable, content-addressed, at a unique position in a single total order:

```jsonc
{
  "seq":    1337,           // bus-assigned position in the total order (trusted)
  "recv":   1748300000.4,   // bus-assigned trusted receive time — fold on this, not ts
  "id":     "b3f1…",        // sha256(canonical(record)) — the content address
  "type":   "deploy.status",// dotted taxonomy; reserved types begin with "_."
  "author": "ci@build-7",   // who appended it
  "ts":     1748300000.0,   // author-stated time (advisory — spoofable, never fold on this)
  "payload": { "…": "…" },  // arbitrary JSON
  "refs": {                 // the only relational mechanism — all values are fact ids,
    "subject": "deploy:prod",  // never agent ids. That is the structural reason
    "parent":  "<id>",         // there are no commands.
    "supersedes": "<id>"       // (also: tombstones · vote · claim_of · resolves · release_of)
  },
  "sig": "hmac…"            // HMAC-SHA256 signed by the bus
}
```

**Two ops, and that's the whole wire surface**: `POST /facts` to append, `GET /facts?since=N` to read. Registers, trails, trust and ownership are *facts about facts*, folded by the reader — see [PROTOCOL.md](PROTOCOL.md).

## Quickstart

**Requires Node.js ≥ 20.** The fastest look, zero config, zero API key, ~15 seconds:

```bash
npx @antlegion/bus demo
```

The real path is a bus and a shell. Boot the bus once, then let any agent — on this machine or another — deposit and read:

```bash
npx @antlegion/bus                                                # 1. a fact log on :28090 (HOST=0.0.0.0 to share it across machines)

# on machine A
alctl publish deploy.status '{"v":42}' --subject deploy:prod      # 2. deposit what you observed

# on machine B — a different agent, a different runtime, no channel but the log
alctl current deploy:prod                                         # 3. what is prod right now?  → the v42 fact
alctl causation <id>                                              #    how did it come to be?
alctl descendants <id>                                            #    what did it lead to?
```

Kill the bus, restart it from its journal, run step 3 again anywhere: same facts, same answers, byte for byte.

For anything you want to keep running, run it the way you run Redis — a container, a volume, a stable secret:

```bash
docker run -d --name antlegion -p 28090:28090 \
  -v antlegion-data:/data -e ANTLEGION_BUS_SECRET=change-me \
  ghcr.io/yangkgcsdms/antlegion          # multi-arch; :latest tracks the newest bus-v* tag
```

The image binds `0.0.0.0` inside the container — the docker network is the trust boundary, so publish the port only where you trust the callers. The volume is the entire persistence story: one append-only journal, which is why a restarted container folds the same world instead of a fresh one. Keep `ANTLEGION_BUS_SECRET` stable — unset, the bus mints a new HMAC key each boot and signatures written before the restart stop verifying (they surface as `sig_failures` in `/info`). To build it yourself, from the repo root: `docker build -t antlegion .`

## Use it from code

The folding SDK absorbs the append-then-read-back-and-fold work (`npm i @antlegion/bus`):

```typescript
import { ClientV2, httpTransport } from "@antlegion/bus/client";

// two agents that share nothing but the bus URL
const sensor  = new ClientV2(httpTransport("http://10.0.0.7:28090"), "sensor@node-a");
const watcher = new ClientV2(httpTransport("http://10.0.0.7:28090"), "watcher@node-b");

// A deposits what it saw, then revises it — a register named by a plain string
const r1 = await sensor.publish("deploy.status", { v: 41 }, { refs: { subject: "deploy:prod" } });
const r2 = await sensor.supersede(r1.id, "deploy.status", { v: 42 });
await sensor.publish("alarm.raised", { why: "p99 up" }, { refs: { parent: r2.id } });

// B, later, on another machine, folds the same world
await watcher.currentOf("deploy:prod");     // → the v42 fact (r1 folds as superseded)
await watcher.historyOf("deploy:prod");     // → [r1, r2] — everything ever said about prod
await watcher.descendants(r2.id);           // → [alarm.raised] — what v42 led to

// Ownership is world state too: two agents both try to own something,
// lowest seq wins, and both compute the same winner from the same stream
const { id } = await sensor.publish("incident.open", { sev: 1 });
const [a, b] = await Promise.all([sensor.claim(id), watcher.claim(id)]);
console.log(a.won !== b.won, await watcher.state(id)); // true, { state: "claimed", owner: … }
```

## Connect the agents you already have

Any agent that can run a shell command — Claude Code, Cursor, Codex CLI, a cron job, a resident daemon on another box — joins the same log through the **`alctl` CLI** (the `redis-cli` analog). Every command prints machine-readable JSON.

```bash
export ANTLEGION_AUTHOR=my-agent@my-host      # stable identity; one identity = one process

alctl publish obs.metric '{"cpu":91}' --subject host:web-3     # write what happened
alctl current host:web-3                                       # read the world
alctl read --type 'deploy.*' --since "$CURSOR"                  # or tail it from a cursor
alctl claim <id> && alctl resolve <id>                          # own a fact (exactly-once), then close it
```

→ Full verb reference, the first prompt to paste into an agent, a rules snippet for `CLAUDE.md` / `.cursorrules`, and a 5-minute two-window experiment: [docs/AGENT-CLI.md](docs/AGENT-CLI.md)

## Host an agent as a resident (DCU mode)

Everything above is an agent someone is driving. The other posture is a **resident**: nobody drives it — the log does. It sits idle until a fact matching what it declared an interest in lands, then wakes, claims that fact so no sibling repeats the work, does the work, and deposits the result back under the original. No queue, no dispatcher, nobody at a prompt.

`@antlegion/dsh` is the AntLegion plugin for **DeepSeek Harness**: run it and that dsh operates as a DCU mounted on the bus — it stands watch, responds to facts on the log by itself, and publishes what it did back as facts. Perception stays plain Node — poll, advance a cursor, fold, select — and only *deciding what to do about a fact* costs an LLM turn.

### Install the plugin

Probe the node first. The address is the one thing the plugin cannot guess, and a wrong one comes back classified (`refused` / `dns` / `timeout` / `not-a-bus`) instead of as a hang:

```bash
npx -p @antlegion/dsh antlegion-dcu-check http://10.0.0.7:28090 --roster   # is this a bus? who is already on it?
```

`dsh plugin` forwards to pnpm inside the profile directory, so installing is one line:

```bash
dsh plugin --profile dcu add @antlegion/dsh
# from a checkout:  dsh plugin --profile dcu add link:/path/to/AntLegion/dsh-antlegion
# straight from git: dsh plugin --profile dcu add "github:YangKGcsdms/AntLegion#path:/dsh-antlegion"
```

Then list the bundle in the profile, and give it an address and its interests:

```jsonc
// ~/.dsh/profiles/dcu/package.json — a dcu profile is dsh-base plus this bundle, nothing else
{ "dsh": { "profile": { "bundles": ["@deepseek-ai/dsh-base", "@antlegion/dsh"] } } }
```

```yaml
# ~/.dsh/profiles/dcu/cordis.patch.yml — a patch replaces the whole config block,
# so restate every key you care about; anything omitted falls back to the schema default
- id: antlegion-dcu
  config:
    busUrl: http://10.0.0.7:28090
    author: dsh-dcu             # its colony identity — one identity, one process
    resident: true              # false mounts the bus tools only, with no patrol
    interests: ["task.*"]       # the fact types that wake it — empty means it never wakes
    publishes: ["task.done"]    # what it declares to the roster
```

`dsh --profile dcu` boots it; `dsh --profile dcu --dump-config` shows the composed tree without booting.

### Keep it running

It is an ordinary long-lived process — put it under whatever supervisor you already run. A systemd user unit:

```ini
# ~/.config/systemd/user/antlegion-dcu.service
[Unit]
Description=AntLegion resident DCU (DeepSeek Harness)
After=network-online.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/env dsh --profile dcu    # absolute path to dsh if the unit's PATH lacks it (nvm, asdf …)
Environment=DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=…              # model credentials otherwise live in ~/.dsh/settings.yaml
Restart=always
RestartSec=5

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

```bash
systemctl --user enable --now antlegion-dcu
journalctl --user -u antlegion-dcu -f   # four boot lines: bus OK · session up · patrol starting · registered
```

`Restart=always` is safe here, and that is a property of the log rather than of the supervisor. A resident that dies holding claims strands nothing: each claim lapses Δ after its bus-stamped `recv` and a sibling picks the work up, without un-doing a `resolve` that did complete. Booting twice costs nothing either — registration is a TTL slot in a `refs.subject` group, so a restart supersedes its own stale entry rather than piling up. Pointing it at a bus that is not up yet is fine too: it backs off, reconnects when the node appears, and re-announces. The one caveat it shares with every agent on the log: **one identity, one process** — two units under one `author` is a double-start, which a fold detects (`sys.identity.conflict`) rather than the bus forbidding.

The same posture with its own runtime instead of a harness is `@antlegion/ant`: `ant start --daemon` detaches a colony (pid, logs and working memory under `./.ant/`), and `ant launchd` prints a plist for macOS boot.

### See it on the board

```bash
alctl colony
# [{"author":"dsh-dcu","interests":["task.*"],"publishes":["task.done"]}]
```

Deposit something it said it cares about, and watch it close the loop with nobody at a prompt:

```bash
alctl publish task.todo '{"title":"summarize the p99 spike"}'   # → {"id":"3729ce03…","seq":14}
alctl state 3729ce03…         # → {"state":"resolved","owner":"dsh-dcu"}
alctl descendants 3729ce03…   # → the task.answer it hung under the request
```

```
the stream, abridged — nobody was at a prompt for any of it
#14  task.todo    @carter                         a fact another node deposited
#15  _.claim      @dsh-dcu   claim_of: 3729ce03…  it folded the log, and took ownership first
#17  _.resolve    @dsh-dcu   resolves: 3729ce03…  work done
#18  task.answer  @dsh-dcu   parent:   3729ce03…  the output, hung under the request — the trail stays on the log
```

`task.*` is only an example, and claiming is not mandatory: a resident that only observes and only deposits is a perfectly good ant.

## Does it actually work?

Runnable scenarios boot a real server, spawn independent agents, and assert a measurable pass gate:

- **Shared view** — 6 sensor nodes deposit and revise readings, one is killed mid-run; 8 cold readers wake at random moments and each folds the whole world (current per subject, history, trail, descendants) into a sha256. Same head ⇒ same hash on every reader; kill + replay the bus ⇒ same hash; a retracted register folds to nothing everywhere; **zero claims in the stream** — this scenario coordinates nothing, it only shares a world.
- **Ownership under contention** — 8 processes from 4 "frameworks" race for 400 facts, `dupes=0`; one is `SIGKILL`ed holding claims and its ownership expires deterministically; the bus is restarted from its journal and comes back byte-identical.
- Plus fan-out/in across 16 workers, crash re-dispatch, consensus-gated decisions, and a causal pipeline with supersession.

```bash
npx tsx examples/scenario-shared-view.ts    # isolated nodes · one world · zero claims
npx tsx examples/demo-killer.ts             # the three-act ownership demo
```

Two things deliberately **not** in the tree: `.data-v2/` (the journal) and `.ant/` (a resident agent's pid, logs, and working memory). Both are runtime state, gitignored at any depth.

## Status

**Alpha** — the core protocol, reference implementation, and single-node operational story are solid. Not yet recommended for untrusted public networks (there is no auth; the bus trusts its callers, same as Redis).

Done: stateless trusted core · append-only journal with `appendfsync` + compaction · reader-fold SDK (registers, trails, trust, ownership) · `alctl` CLI · cross-language conformance vectors with an independent Python verifier · shared-view + ownership scenarios · Docker image · ~160k appends/s in-process · 176 tests · npm packages · resident agents (`ant init` / `ant start`, `@antlegion/dsh`).

Next: multi-language client SDKs (Go, Python, Rust — the [conformance vectors](antlegion-bus/conformance/vectors.json) are the test target) · a paper-grade rewrite of `PROTOCOL.md` ([docs/protocol/](docs/protocol/)) · auth + rate limiting for exposed deployments · replication/HA ([§7](PROTOCOL.md)).

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. **Protocol changes are wire-breaking**: any change to the fact shape, the `id` computation (§4), or the §3 fold rules must land in `PROTOCOL.md`, `conformance/vectors.json` (regenerate with `npx tsx conformance/generate.ts`), and the cross-language verifier — together, in one commit that declares `[protocol-change]`.

```bash
npm test                      # 176 tests, ~1s
npx tsc --noEmit              # type check
python3 conformance/verify.py # cross-language hash proof
```
