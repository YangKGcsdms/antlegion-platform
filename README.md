# AntLegion

**A shared world-state log for AI agents that share nothing else.** Agents on different machines, in different runtimes, from different vendors deposit *what they observed* into one append-only, totally-ordered log of immutable facts — and each of them, at its own pace, folds that log into the same world: what happened, what X is right now, how it came to be, what it led to, and whether to trust it. Nobody commands anybody. Nobody relays state by hand. Local, embeddable infrastructure (think Redis, not SaaS).

## The problem it solves

Run agents that don't share a process — a Claude Code session on your laptop, a Codex job in CI, a resident agent on a server, a vendor's hosted agent — and the *only* thing carrying state between them is you, pasting from one window into the next. Inside one process tree there are subagents, teams, shared memory. Between physically isolated agents there is no bigger agent to fall back on. There is a human relay.

AntLegion replaces the relay with a log. Think ants, not armies: an ant never tells another ant what to do. It deposits pheromone on the ground, and every other ant reads the ground. Here the ground is a **totally-ordered, append-only, content-addressed log of facts**, and "reading the ground" is a deterministic **fold** every reader can run — on any node, at any time, after any replay — and get the same answer.

## The core idea

**Facts, not commands.**

`"deploy:prod is at v42"` is a fact and belongs on the log.
`"worker-3, deploy v42"` is a command — it has a recipient, and the log has none.

Every fact's `refs` name **a fact, or a piece of the world — never a party** — a fact can say what it is *about*, it cannot say who it is *for*. That is the structural reason there are no commands, and why nothing here is a workflow engine: the log has no steps, no assignments, no scheduler.

The bus enforces exactly one thing: **total order**. Everything a reader wants to know about the shared world is a fold over that order (`PROTOCOL.md` §8, normative):

| question | fold |
|---|---|
| **what is X right now** | the `subject` register — highest seq wins; retracted folds to nothing, never to a stale value |
| **how did this come to be · what did it lead to** | the causal trail — `parent` links walked back to a root, or forward to every descendant |
| **can it be trusted** | corroborate / contradict votes, quorum is the reader's policy |
| **who is responsible for it** | the lowest-seq live `claim_of` — ownership is world state too, and exactly-once falls out as a theorem of order |

That order is deliberate: it is the order an isolated agent actually asks in, and the last question is **a corollary, not the purpose**. A stream with no claim in it is a perfectly good world.

Two readers folding the same stream always agree. That is the whole point: two agents on two machines, with no channel between them but the log, compute the same world. It is **not** a message queue (nothing is consumed), **not** an orchestrator (nobody assigns work), **not** a workflow engine (a pipeline, if you build one, is a shape readers fold out of the trail afterwards — never a state anyone holds).

## The fact

One primitive, immutable, content-addressed, at a unique position in a single total order:

```jsonc
{
  "seq":    1337,           // bus-assigned position in the total order (trusted)
  "recv":   1748300000.4,   // bus-assigned trusted receive time — fold on this, not ts
  "id":     "b3f1…",        // sha256(RFC 8785 JCS of the record) — the content address
  "type":   "deploy.status",// dotted taxonomy; reserved types begin with "_."
  "author": "ci@build-7",   // who appended it
  "ts":     1748300000.0,   // author-stated time (advisory — spoofable, never fold on this)
  "payload": { "…": "…" },  // arbitrary JSON
  "refs": {                 // the only relational mechanism — every value names a fact
    "subject": "deploy:prod",  // or a piece of the world, never a party. That is the
    "parent":  "<id>",         // structural reason there are no commands. (also:
    "supersedes": "<id>"       //  tombstones · vote · claim_of · resolves · release_of
  },                           //  · about · answers)
  "sig": "hmac…"            // HMAC-SHA256 signed by the bus
}
```

**Two ops, and that's the whole wire surface**: `POST /facts` to append, `GET /facts?since=N` to read. Registers, trails, trust and ownership are *facts about facts*, folded by the reader — see [PROTOCOL.md](PROTOCOL.md).

Not every link is taken at face value. `claim_of`/`resolves`/`release_of`/`tombstones` are **lifecycle refs** — a fact may carry at most one — and a reader gates several keys before honouring them: you may only supersede or retract **your own** fact, only the current claim winner may resolve one, and you may not vote on your own ([§10.1](PROTOCOL.md), new in v3.0).

## Quickstart

**Requires Node.js ≥ 20.** The fastest look, zero config, zero API key, ~15 seconds:

```bash
npx @antlegion/bus demo
```

The real path is a bus and a shell. Boot the bus once, then let any agent — on this machine or another — deposit and read:

```bash
npx @antlegion/bus                                                # 1. a fact log on :28090 (HOST=0.0.0.0 to share it across machines)

# on machine A
alctl publish deploy.status '{"v":42}' --subject deploy:prod      # 2. deposit what you observed

# on machine B — a different agent, a different runtime, no channel but the log
alctl current deploy:prod                                         # 3. what is prod right now?  → the v42 fact
alctl causation <id>                                              #    how did it come to be?
alctl descendants <id>                                            #    what did it lead to?
```

Kill the bus, restart it from its journal, run step 3 again anywhere: same facts, same answers, byte for byte.

## Use it from code

The folding SDK absorbs the append-then-read-back-and-fold work (`npm i @antlegion/bus`):

```typescript
import { ClientV2, httpTransport } from "@antlegion/bus/client";

// two agents that share nothing but the bus URL
const sensor  = new ClientV2(httpTransport("http://10.0.0.7:28090"), "sensor@node-a");
const watcher = new ClientV2(httpTransport("http://10.0.0.7:28090"), "watcher@node-b");

// A deposits what it saw, then revises it — a register named by a plain string
const r1 = await sensor.publish("deploy.status", { v: 41 }, { refs: { subject: "deploy:prod" } });
const r2 = await sensor.supersede(r1.id, "deploy.status", { v: 42 });
await sensor.publish("alarm.raised", { why: "p99 up" }, { refs: { parent: r2.id } });

// B, later, on another machine, folds the same world
await watcher.currentOf("deploy:prod");     // → the v42 fact (r1 folds as superseded)
await watcher.historyOf("deploy:prod");     // → [r1, r2] — everything ever said about prod
await watcher.descendants(r2.id);           // → [alarm.raised] — what v42 led to

// Ownership is world state too: two agents both try to own something,
// lowest seq wins, and both compute the same winner from the same stream
const { id } = await sensor.publish("incident.open", { sev: 1 });
const [a, b] = await Promise.all([sensor.claim(id), watcher.claim(id)]);
console.log(a.won !== b.won, await watcher.state(id)); // true, { state: "claimed", owner: … }
```

## Connect the agents you already have

Any agent that can run a shell command — Claude Code, Cursor, Codex CLI, a cron job, a resident daemon on another box — joins the same log through the **`alctl` CLI** (the `redis-cli` analog). Every command prints machine-readable JSON.

```bash
export ANTLEGION_AUTHOR=my-agent@my-host      # stable identity; one identity = one process

alctl publish obs.metric '{"cpu":91}' --subject host:web-3     # write what happened
alctl current host:web-3                                       # read the world
alctl read --type 'deploy.*' --since "$CURSOR"                  # or tail it from a cursor
alctl claim <id> && alctl resolve <id>                          # own a fact (exactly-once), then close it
```

## Does it actually work?

Runnable scenarios boot a real server, spawn independent agents, and assert a measurable pass gate:

- **Shared view** — 6 sensor nodes deposit and revise readings, one is killed mid-run; 8 cold readers wake at random moments and each folds the whole world (current per subject, history, trail, descendants) into a sha256. Same head ⇒ same hash on every reader; kill + replay the bus ⇒ same hash; a retracted register folds to nothing everywhere; **zero claims in the stream** — this scenario coordinates nothing, it only shares a world.
- **Ownership under contention** — 8 processes from 4 "frameworks" race for 400 facts, `dupes=0`; one is `SIGKILL`ed holding claims and its ownership expires deterministically; the bus is restarted from its journal and comes back byte-identical.
- Plus fan-out/in across 16 workers, crash re-dispatch, consensus-gated decisions, and a causal pipeline with supersession.

```bash
npx tsx examples/scenario-shared-view.ts    # isolated nodes · one world · zero claims
npx tsx examples/demo-killer.ts             # the three-act ownership demo
```

```

Two things deliberately **not** in the tree: `.data-v2/` (the journal) and `.ant/` (a resident agent's pid, logs, and working memory). Both are runtime state, gitignored at any depth.

## Status

**Alpha** — the reference implementation and the single-node operational story are solid. Not yet recommended for untrusted public networks (there is no network auth; the bus trusts its callers, same as Redis).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **v3.0 is wire-breaking, and it has landed.** The spec, the bus, the folding SDK and the [conformance vectors](antlegion-bus/conformance/vectors.json) all speak v3.0; canonicalization is now **RFC 8785 (JCS)**, which changes every `id`. A v2.0 log fails `id` verification on every record under a v3.0 reader — there is no migration path and none is offered. Start a new log; archive a v2.0 one and read it with a v2.0 reader. Full change list: [§C](PROTOCOL.md).

Both satellite packages speak v3.0 too: `ant` and `@antlegion/dsh` fold with the bus-published Δ, surface trail gaps instead of hiding them, and retire their own registrations by retraction now that supersession alone no longer licenses compaction. CI builds the bus from the commit under test and runs both against it. Their `package.json` asks for `@antlegion/bus@^0.5.0`, which resolves from npm once that version is published — until then, install them the way CI does:

```bash
cd antlegion-bus && npm ci && npm run build && npm pack --pack-destination /tmp
cd ../ant && npm install --no-save /tmp/antlegion-bus-0.5.0.tgz
```

For `@antlegion/dsh` that is one of three install traps (the others: the `@deepseek-ai` `latest` tag points at a release whose own dependencies 404, and the peer graph does not resolve in reasonable time). `dsh-antlegion/setup-dcu-profile.sh` handles all three and builds a bootable profile; `dsh-antlegion/verify-loop.sh` then drives the whole loop — register, be woken by another author's fact, claim, resolve, publish — with no model key.

### What it does not do

Three limits worth knowing before you build on it, all of them consequences of the design rather than gaps in it:

- **A reader's memory grows with the log's age, without bound.** §8.0 requires a complete prefix and §11.2 forbids compaction from reclaiming the skeleton, so every conforming reader holds the whole log's `{id, seq, recv, author, refs, sig}` forever, and answering one question is O(N). At 10⁵ facts the reference folds are still milliseconds; a log that runs for years needs incremental folds, checkpointed derived state, or splitting by subject space ([§2.3](PROTOCOL.md)). This is the price of "the bus is stateless and meaning lives in readers", not a bug.
- **`author` is self-asserted, so the §10.1 gates protect honest participants, not against adversaries.** Every gate — only your own fact may be retracted or superseded by you, only the claim winner may resolve — compares an `author` nobody authenticated. Inside a trusted network that is exactly right; on an open one, every §8 guarantee except §9.1's ordering result is relative to `author` being honest ([§12.2](PROTOCOL.md)).
- **One log is one world.** `seq` is meaningful only within a log, so folds never span two ([§2.4](PROTOCOL.md)). Read replicas and sharding by subject space are fine; two writers for one log is a different protocol. The bus's availability is the world's availability.

`research/protocol-v3-audit-2026-08.md` argues all three, and what survives them.

Done: stateless trusted core · append-only journal with `appendfsync`, torn-tail recovery and fold-preserving compaction · reader-fold SDK (registers, trails, trust, ownership) with the §10.1 authorization gates · `alctl` CLI · cross-language conformance vectors whose independent Python verifier checks **folds, not just hashes** (204 assertions) · shared-view + ownership scenarios · Docker image · ~160k appends/s in-process · Δ pinned to the log, so a restart cannot silently re-fold its history · 405 tests across the three packages (263 bus · 119 ant · 23 dsh) · npm packages · resident agents (`ant init` / `ant start`, `@antlegion/dsh`).

Next: multi-language client SDKs (Go, Python, Rust — the [conformance vectors](antlegion-bus/conformance/vectors.json) are the test target) · auth + rate limiting for exposed deployments ([§10.3](PROTOCOL.md)) · replication/HA ([§11.3](PROTOCOL.md)) · length-prefixed `sig` fields ([§5.10](PROTOCOL.md)).

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. **Protocol changes are wire-breaking**: any change to the fact shape, the `id` computation (§5.9), or the §8 fold rules must land in `PROTOCOL.md`, `PROTOCOL.zh-CN.md`, `conformance/vectors.json` (regenerate with `npx tsx conformance/generate.ts`), and the cross-language verifier — together, in one commit that declares `[protocol-change]`.

The rule's useful half runs the other way, and it is the cheapest review tool here: **a change that only restates the spec must leave every vector byte-identical.** If you rewrote prose and `vectors.json` moved, you changed semantics without meaning to.

```bash
npm test                      # 263 tests in the bus, ~2s
npx tsc --noEmit              # type check
python3 conformance/verify.py # cross-language proof: 204 assertions, folds included
```
